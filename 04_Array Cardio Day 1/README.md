 - The `map()` method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying a function to each one of the elements of the first array.
 - The `filter()` method takes each element in an array and it applies a conditional statement against it. 
 - The `reduce()` method reduces an array of values down to just one value. To get the output value, it runs a reducer function on each element of the array.
 - The `sort()` method sorts the items of an array and returns array.
