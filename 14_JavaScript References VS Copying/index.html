        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    
        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    
        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

        const people5= Array.from(players);
        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        const person1= person;
        person1.number=60;
        console.log(person1);
    
        // how do we take a copy instead?
